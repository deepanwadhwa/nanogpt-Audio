# nanogpt-Audio

This project is inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's nanogpt](https://github.com/karpathy/nanogpt).

## Project Description

In this project, I generated audio from Shakespeare's works using a text-to-speech model. Then, I trained a transformer model solely on this audio data. The output you hear is sound that the model has learned to generate from scratch, capturing the patterns and structures of the training audio.

## Sample Output

Listen to a sample aligned output generated by the model:

<audio controls src="aligned_sample.wav"></audio>
